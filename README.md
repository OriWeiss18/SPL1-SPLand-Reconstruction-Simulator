# SPL1
SPLand Reconstruction Simulator is a project that simulates a system for planning and rebuilding settlements after a war. The system considers different strategies for constructing essential facilities such as schools and office buildings while analyzing the impact of each decision on the settlement.
The project is implemented in C++ and incorporates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, the Rule of 5 for efficient memory management, and standard data structures.
The simulation receives a configuration file as input, initializes the settlementsâ€™ initial state, and manages the reconstruction process based on a chosen strategy. The system supports dynamic user actions during the simulation, including creating new plans, constructing facilities, and executing simulation steps.
